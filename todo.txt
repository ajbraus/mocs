  #2 Homepage  - A key and important feature of any project is Estimated Time: 120 min Duration: 5 months. That is more important than #Views, which could be deleted.

  #3 Homepage  - The start date and end date is causing clutter and is not thaaat important. We can talk later about what items should occupy this prime real estate.
